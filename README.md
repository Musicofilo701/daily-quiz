#  Daily  Quiz – React App

A sweet little web app built for my girlfriend.  
Every day, she gets a new multiple-choice question — if she answers correctly, she wins a reward (like breakfast or a massage)! 🎁

## 🌟 Features

- One **daily question**, for 8 days starting on **Thursday, June 13**
- All questions are **multiple choice**
- If she gets the **correct answer**, a surprise **reward or household chore** is revealed
- If she gets it **wrong**, the reward is still shown… but marked as "missed" 😅
- Answers are saved per day — no second tries!
- **Mobile-first** design for easy use on phones
- A live **countdown** appears before the quiz starts
